# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Hey there! Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (which we'll call "the Site" or "us" from here on out). 🤝 Before you dive in and start using our services, give these Terms of Service a quick read. By accessing or using the Site, you're totally agreeing to and accepting these terms. ✨

## 1. What We Offer
The Site is here to hook you up with awesome paid subscription content and exclusive membership services. These goodies include, but are not limited to, blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, community interactions, and more! Heads up: Some of the good stuff is only for our subscribed members. 😉

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
- Users gotta provide a valid email address and pick a password to sign up for an account. 📧
- Users are solely responsible for keeping their account secure and for all the happenings under their login. And big NO-NO: transferring or sharing your account is strictly forbidden! 🚫
- The Site reserves the right to pause or even permanently close down accounts if users ever decide to violate these terms. 🚨

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
- Subscription services run on a monthly or annual billing cycle. The exact fees? You'll see 'em crystal clear on the checkout page. 💸
- All payments are handled through trusted third-party payment platforms (think Stripe or PayPal). Don't sweat it – we never store your payment info on our end! 🛡️
- Your subscription will **automatically renew** unless you hit that cancel button before your current billing period wraps up. 🔄
- **Our 14-day refund policy** is pretty sweet for first-time subscribers: If you're not totally thrilled with our service within 14 days of your initial purchase, you can snag a full refund. No worries! Just shoot us an email at the contact address at the bottom of these terms, explaining why you're looking for a refund. Heads up: This full refund is a one-time deal per user. If it's past 14 days or if you're not a first-time subscriber, all sales are final – **no refunds** after payment, unless the law literally forces us to. Tough luck, but fair's fair! 😉

## 4. Content Usage & Intellectual Property
- All original content? That's **copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday)**, plain and simple. So, no copying, republishing, or using it for commercial purposes without our explicit permission. 🚫
- Users only get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access** our content. This access is strictly for your personal learning and reading pleasure, nothing else. 📖
- If you're thinking about commercial use or dropping a ton of quotes, hit us up for authorization first! 📧

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
- It's a big no-no to upload, post, or spread any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringing on anyone else's rights. 🙅‍♀️
- And definitely **don't** use any tech wizardry to bulk download, scrape, or crack our exclusive member content. 💻
- The Site reserves the right to yank down any inappropriate content and will **ban users** who break these rules. Just sayin'! 😉

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
- We totally reserve the right to tweak, pause, or even completely stop parts or all of our services at any time, without giving you a heads-up beforehand. 🚧
- If you can't access content temporarily because of stuff like force majeure, server hiccups, or third-party service interruptions, the Site **won't be liable for any compensation**. It's just how the tech cookie crumbles sometimes! 🤷‍♀️

## 7. Disclaimer
- Just a heads-up: The info we provide on the Site is purely for reference. It **doesn't count** as professional advice of any kind (like financial, legal, medical, etc.). So, don't take it as gospel! 🚫
- For any direct or indirect losses you might rack up from using our content or services, the Site **isn't going to be responsible**. Just wanted to make that clear! 😉

## 8. Governing Law
- These Terms of Service are gonna be governed by, and interpreted in accordance with, the laws of California, USA 🇺🇸, totally disregarding any conflict of law principles.
- For any disputes that pop up from or are related to these terms, both parties agree to first try and sort things out with a friendly chat. If that doesn't work, you're agreeing to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County, California. So there! ⚖️
